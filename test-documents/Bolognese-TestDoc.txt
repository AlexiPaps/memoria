# Authentic Ragù alla Bolognese – The Real Deal


Forget the "spaghetti bolognese" you see abroad. In Bologna, the sauce is served with **tagliatelle** (never spaghetti) and is slow-cooked for hours.


Serves 4–6 | Cooking time: 3–4 hours


## Ingredients


- 300 g beef mince (15–20 % fat – chuck or brisket)
- 150 g pancetta, finely chopped
- 1 medium onion, finely diced
- 1 carrot, finely diced
- 1 celery stalk, finely diced
- 50 g tomato paste (double-concentrated)
- 125 ml whole milk
- 125 ml dry white wine
- 250–300 ml beef or chicken stock (unsalted)
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Fine sea salt & freshly ground black pepper
- Fresh tagliatelle (400–500 g) or rigatoni
- Parmigiano-Reggiano, to serve


## Method


1. **Soffritto**  
   Heat olive oil in a heavy pot over low heat. Add pancetta and cook gently until fat renders (5 min). Add onion with a pinch of salt – cook slowly until translucent (10 min). Add carrot and celery – continue cooking until soft and sweet (another 10–15 min).


2. **Meat**  
   Increase heat to medium-high. Add beef mince in small pieces – do NOT stir immediately. Let it brown and form a crust (this is flavor!). After 5–6 minutes, break it up and cook until no pink remains.


3. **Tomato & Wine**  
   Add tomato paste – fry for 3–4 minutes until it darkens slightly. Pour in white wine – scrape the bottom. Let alcohol evaporate completely.


4. **The Slow Part**  
   Add milk – stir until absorbed (this tenderizes the meat). Start adding stock a little at a time – only enough to barely cover. Reduce heat to the lowest possible simmer. Cook uncovered for **at least 3 hours** (4 is better), stirring occasionally and adding stock only when needed. The sauce should be thick, rich, and barely coat the spoon.


5. **Finish**  
   Taste and adjust salt & pepper. The ragù should be intensely flavorful but balanced.


6. **Serve**  
   Cook fresh tagliatelle in salted water. Drain when very al dente. Toss directly in the pot with ragù over low heat for 1 minute. Serve with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.
